See Appendix E.3 of Fatih Guvenen, Gueorgui Kambourov, Burhan Kuruscu, Sergio Ocampo, Daphne Chen, Use It or Lose It: Efficiency and Redistributional Effects of Wealth Taxation, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Volume 138, Issue 2, May 2023, Pages 835â€“894, https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjac047 

Currently, their results do not replicate fully. In particular, they write that they choose e_4 (the level of the awesome productivity state) to match a wealth share of top 1 equal to 30%. Given the value they report, e_4=265, the wealth share held by top 1% is only around 20%.
